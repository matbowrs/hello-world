First commit

Unfortuantely, I cannot change the font to Comic Sans.

I'm currently a student at Kennesaw State University in Georgia majoring in Computer Science with ambitions to work in the fields of machine learning, big data, or theoretical computer science (but if I'm applying to a front or backend position, I absolutely love this front and/or backend position that I'm applying to). I'm not sure if I can say that I'm fully fluent in a language, other than French, but I have experience working with Java, a little C++, Python and a little Javascript (and HTML and all that).
