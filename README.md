Unfortuantely, I cannot change the font to Comic Sans.

I'm currently a student at Kennesaw State University in Georgia majoring in Computer Science with ambitions to work in web development. I've spent some time working with it and I enjoy it quite a lot. I'm not sure if I can say that I'm fully fluent in a language, other than French, but I have (some) experience building small projects using JavaScript, Node.js (Express framework), Vue.js and MongoDB.
